# SolidWorks-Automation
A collection of time saving SolidWorks macros

Most of these files are a .swp file type which is a Visual Basic script for SolidWorks.
To run a SolidWorks macro, you can:

  Open the macro directly from SolidWorks
  
  Click "Run Macro" and browse to the file location
  
  Assign the macro to key board shortcut (http://help.solidworks.com/2016/english/solidworks/sldworks/t_assigning_macro_keyboard_shortcut.htm)
  
  Or assign the macro to a custom button (http://help.solidworks.com/2016/english/solidworks/sldworks/t_assigning_macro_toolbar_button.htm)
